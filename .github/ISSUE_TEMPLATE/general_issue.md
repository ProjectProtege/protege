## Goal

What will this issue accomplish?

_Example: This issue will refactor component X, reducing bundle size and improving load times._

## Context

How will this improvement affect the application? Give plenty of context.

_Example: Component X currently retrieves the apples needed one at a time. This refactor will allow to grab all of the apples at once, and then distribute them as needed._

### Notes

Have an idea how this could be accomplished? Leave notes here!

## Definition of Done

_Example: Add a list of benchmarks to measure issue completion._

- [ ] appleGrab function uses .map rather than for loop
- [ ] Component X grabs all apples at once
- [ ] apples distribute as needed, faster

## Out of scope

Does anything seem related but shouldn't be addressed here?
